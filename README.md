With Viz Tab, you can easily save browsing sessions to quickly recall them for future use. Viz Tab creates a visual snapshot of all your open tabs so that they can be easily organized and recalled later with just one click.

Ideal for users who need several tabs open based on a specific project or interest. With Viz Tab you can open a full browsing session organized by project, group, or subject in seconds, instead of wasting time searching through bookmarks and visited sites to recreate a session.

Viz Tab can also be set as the default home page that opens whenever a new tab is opened. Categories and pages can quickly be renamed to make organizing even easier.
